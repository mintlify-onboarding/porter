title: "HTTPS and Domains"

Porter secures all application endpoints with SSL using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). There are three options for domains:

* [Porter Domains](/deploying-applications/https-and-domains/porter-domains) \-- these domains are of the form `*.onporter.run`. They are designed to be used for testing and staging environments, but are not meant to run production applications.
* [Custom Domains](/deploying-applications/https-and-domains/custom-domains) \-- this guide shows you how to set up a custom domain for your applications.
* [Wildcard Domains](/deploying-applications/https-and-domains/wildcard-domains) \-- this guide shows you how to set up a wildcard domain that can use the same SSL certificate per subdomain.

To view more details about viewing SSL certificates, see the [SSL Certificates](/deploying-applications/https-and-domains/ssl-certificates) guide.
