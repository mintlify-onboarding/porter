title: "Deploying from a Github Repository"
---

Porter lets you deploy a service directly from a Git repository. By default, services on Porter automatically update whenever there is a push to the primary branch (usually `main` or `master`) of the connected repo.

##### Prerequisites

* A repository (public or private) hosted on GitHub
* A Kubernetes cluster and container registry linked to Porter (linked by default if you following the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/overview))

These docs will guide you through getting your applications set up and integrated with Github:

* [Adding/Updating the Porter Github App](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github/adding-updating-gh-app) \-- if you have not already linked a Github app, this guide will walk you through how to add/update the Github repositories that Porter has access to, and explains the Github app setup in more detail.
* [Selecting an Application and Build Method](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github/selecting-application-and-build-method) \-- this guide documents the steps required to get your application linked up with Porter.
* [Customizing your Github Workflow](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github/customizing-github-workflow) \-- explains how to modify your Github workflow, for example to run DB migrations or tests before deployment, and advanced configuration options like adding build-time environment variables.
