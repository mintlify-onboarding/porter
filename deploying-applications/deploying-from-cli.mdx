title: "Deploying from the CLI"
---

Porter lets you create and update applications using the CLI. By default, the CLI builds your application, pushes it to a Docker registry, and re-deploys your application on Porter. Note that these commands are used internally when you [deploy from Github](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github) or [use your own CI tools](/deploying-applications/using-other-ci-tools).

##### Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster and container registry linked to Porter (linked by default if you following the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/overview))
* The Porter CLI installed ([view installation instructions](/cli/installation)).

This section contains the following guides:

* [Creating an Application from the CLI](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-cli/creating-an-application)
* [Updating an Application from the CLI](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-cli/updating-an-application)
* [Common Configuration Options](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-cli/common-configuration-options)

For a full overview of the CLI, see the [CLI section of the docs](/cli/installation).
