Porter lets you deploy a Docker image directly from a linked container registry.

<Card title="Prerequisites">
  * A Kubernetes cluster linked to Porter (linked by default if you following the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/overview))
</Card>

These docs will guide you through getting your applications set up and integrated with Github:

* [Linking an existing Docker Registry](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-docker-registry/linking-existing-registry) \-- this guide will show you how to add or update your container registry.
* [Deploying from a Docker Registry](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-docker-registry/deploying) \-- this guide documents the steps required to get your image deployed with Porter.

You can update your service after it has been deployed by triggering a generated webhook or by manually redeploying with a specific image tag.
