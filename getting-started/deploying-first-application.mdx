Now that you've deployed your Porter cluster, you can deploy your first application to the cluster! In this example, we'll deploy a pre-built `hello-world` application to verify that everything is working correctly.

## Launch your Application[](#launch-your-application "Direct link to heading")

On the Porter dashboard, navigate to the **Launch** tab. From here, click on the **Web** option and click **Launch template**. On the next screen, name your application `porter-hello-world` and select **Docker registry** as the application type. When asked to select a container image, simply input `public.ecr.aws/o1j4x7p4/porter-hello-world:latest` as follows:
