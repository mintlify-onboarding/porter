title: "Provisioning Infrastructure"
---

Porter provisions and manages the underlying infrastructure in your own cloud. During project creation, Porter will prompt you to provision resources in one of the three cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Digital Ocean.

For step by step instructions on how to provision infrastructure in each cloud provider, see the links below.

* [Provisioning on AWS](/getting-started/provisioning-on-aws)
* [Provisioning on Google Cloud](/getting-started/provisioning-on-gcp)
* [Provisioning on Digital Ocean](/getting-started/provisioning-on-do)

As mentioned in the [previous section](/getting-started/linking-application-source), Porter provisions a Kubernetes cluster and an image registry in your cloud provider. It is not necessary to know much about the provisioned resources to use Porter, other than a few basic concepts. For those looking for a brief introduction to Kubernetes, we cover these basic concepts in [Kubernetes 101](/other/kubernetes-101).

## FAQ[](#faq "Direct link to heading")

### Which instance type should I select?[](#which-instance-type-should-i-select "Direct link to heading")

The instance type you select depends on how much resources each of your application requires. Each of your application cannot exceed the amount of resources available on a single instance. For example, if you want to run an application with 4GB memory on AWS, the instance type you select should be larger than the `t2.medium` instances because they only have 2 vCPU and 4GB memory.

You can [read more about how resource allocation works on Kubernetes here](/other/kubernetes-101). If you are unsure which instance type you should select, [book a free consultation call with our solution architects](mailto:contact@porter.run).

### How much does the underlying infrastructure cost?[](#how-much-does-the-underlying-infrastructure-cost "Direct link to heading")

The cost of your infrastructure varies entirely on the amount of resources you use. By default, clusters provisioned by Porter cost around $200 per month on AWS and GCP, and around $100 per month on Digital Ocean.
