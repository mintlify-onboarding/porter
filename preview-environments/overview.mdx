##### Beta Notice

Preview Environments are currently in `beta` and are not enabled on Porter projects by default. Please reach out on Discord or over email if you'd like to participate in beta-testing preview environments.

_Preview Environments_ are isolated instances of your application used for testing purposes. You can configure Porter to create a preview environment for every new pull request made to your Github repository. There are three steps required to get preview environments working with your application:

* Make sure preview environments are enabled for your cluster
* Preview environments enabled for your desired Github repository
* A `porter.yaml` file at the root of your repository

While we recommend you to read more about the concepts used in Porter Preview Environments, you may choose to skip to the setup guide to start using Preview Environments.
