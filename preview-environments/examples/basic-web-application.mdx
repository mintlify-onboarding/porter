In this example, we'll walk through an example of enabling preview environments for a simple Go application, built via a cloud-native buildpack. The sample repository can be found [here](https://github.com/porter-dev/go-getting-started).

## `porter.yaml` File Walkthrough[](#porteryaml-file-walkthrough "Direct link to heading")

The `porter.yaml` file for this application is as follows:

```
version: "v1"
resources:
  - name: "go-sample"
    source:
      name: "web"
    config:
      build:
        method: "pack"
      values:
        container:
          command: "go-getting-started"
          port: 8080
          env:
            normal:
              BPE_PORT: "8080"
              BP_KEEP_FILES: "static/*"

```

* `source`: By only setting the `source.name` field to `web`, Porter will deploy this as a `web` application.
* `config.build`: specifying the `config.build.method` field as `pack` instructs Porter to build this application using cloud-native buildpacks.
* `config.values`: here, we set common configuration settings, such as the start command, the port that the application runs on, and environment variables for the application.
