title: "Porter YAML Reference"
---

This document contains a full reference file for `porter.yaml`. Each `porter.yaml` file has the following high-level structure:

* [version](#version) \- the version of the `porter.yaml` file reference to use.
* [resources](#resources) \- a list of resources to create.  
   * [name](#resourcename) \- the unique ID of the resource.  
   * [driver](#resourcedriver) \- the name of the driver to use for the resource.  
   * [depends\_on](#resourcedepends%5Fon) \- the resources that the target resources depends on.  
   * [source](#resourcesource) \- the source configuration, specifying the application/addon to use.  
   * [target](#resourcetarget) \- the target configuration, specifying the specifics of the project, cluster, etc., the application/addon should be deployed to.  
   * [config](#resourceconfig) \- the build and runtime configuration for the addon or application.

## `version`[](#version "Direct link to heading")

The version of the `porter.yaml` file reference to use. Currently, only `v1` is supported:

```
version: v1

```

## `resources`[](#resources "Direct link to heading")

A list of resources to create. For example:

```
---
resources:
  - name: "resource-1"
    source:
      name: "web"
  - name: "resource-2"
    depends_on:
      - "resource-1"
    source:
      name: "web"

```

### `<resource>.name`[](#resourcename "Direct link to heading")

The name of the resource to create.

### `<resource>.driver`[](#resourcedriver "Direct link to heading")

The name of the driver the resource should use. For more about drivers, see the [Drivers section](/preview-environments/drivers) of the documentation.

### `<resource>.depends_on`[](#resourcedepends%5Fon "Direct link to heading")

A list of resources that the target resource depends on.

```
---
resources:
  - name: "resource-1"
    source:
      name: "web"
  - name: "resource-2"
    depends_on:
      - "resource-1"

```

### `<resource>.source`[](#resourcesource "Direct link to heading")

The source specifies the application/addon to deploy for this resource. More specifically, it uniquely identifies a Helm chart. It contains the following fields:

* `name` \[`String`, required\] \- the name of the template to use. Since the default source repo is [https://charts.getporter.dev](https://charts.getporter.dev), the names `web`, `worker`, and `job` work by default.
* `repo` \[`String`, optional\] \- the Helm repository URL to use. Currently supported are `https://charts.getporter.dev` and `https://chart-addons.getporter.dev`.
* `version` \[`String`, optional\] \- the semver version of the chart to use. If no version is specified, the latest version is used.

For example, to deploy a worker application:

```
---
resources:
  - name: "web-example"
    source:
      name: "worker" # this could also be "web" or "job"

```

To deploy `postgresql`, a supported addon:

```
---
resources:
  - name: "postgres"
    source:
      name: "postgresql"
      repo: "https://chart-addons.getporter.dev"

```

### `<resource>.target`[](#resourcetarget "Direct link to heading")

The target specifies the specifics of the project, cluster, etc., the application/addon should be deployed to. More specifically, it contains the following fields:

* `project` \[`Integer`, optional\] \- the Porter project ID to deploy the resource to. This is resolved in the following manner:  
   * Checks for the `PORTER_PROJECT` environment variable and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.  
   * Next, checks for the value of `target.project` in the `porter.yaml` file and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.  
   * Lastly, defaults back to the CLI configuration value for the project, set by using the `porter config set-project` command.
* `cluster` \[`Integer`, optional\] \- the Porter cluster ID in the project to deploy the resource to. This is resolved in the following manner:  
   * Checks for the `PORTER_CLUSTER` environment variable and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.  
   * Next, checks for the value of `target.cluster` in the `porter.yaml` file and uses it if it is set to a non-zero value.  
   * Lastly, defaults back to the CLI configuration value for the cluster, set by using the `porter config set-cluster` command.
* `namespace` \[`String`, optional\] \- the namespace in the cluster to deploy the resource to. This is resolved in the following manner:  
   * Checks for the `PORTER_NAMESPACE` environment variable and uses it if it is set to a non-empty string.  
   * Next, checks for the value of `target.namespace` in the `porter.yaml` file and uses it if it is set to a non-empty string.  
   * Lastly, uses the `default` namespace if the above steps do not resolve to a non-empty string value.

**Note:** In some cases, the `target` section can also contain the `app_name` field to denote the Porter release name.

For example, to deploy a resource to a specific project, cluster, and namespace:

```
---
resources:
  - name: "web-example"
    target:
      project: 1
      cluster: 1
      namespace: "dev"

```

### `<resource>.config`[](#resourceconfig "Direct link to heading")

The `config` block specifies build and runtime configuration for the application or addon.

#### Application Config[](#application-config "Direct link to heading")

If the resource is a `web`, `worker`, or `job` application, the `config` block expects the following fields:

* `build` \[required\] \- the build configuration to use.  
   * `method` \[`docker`, `pack`, or `registry`\] \- the build/deploy method to use: the Docker daemon, cloud-native buildpacks or deployment from a Docker registry.  
   * `dockerfile` \[`String`, optional\] \- if the build method is `docker`, the path to the Dockerfile  
   * `builder` \[`String`, optional\] \- if the build method is `pack`, the builder to use. Leaving this blank will default to `paketobuildpacks/builder:full`. Other well-supported options are `heroku/buildpacks:20` and `heroku/buildpacks:18`.  
   * `buildpacks` \[`String`, optional\] \- if the build method is `pack`, the buildpacks to use. Leaving this empty will default to the buildpacks supported by `paketo` and `heroku`, depending on the builder.  
   * `context` \[`String`, optional\] \- if the build method is `docker` or `pack`, the path to the application directory. Defaults to the current (root) directory.  
   * `image` \[`String`, required if `method=registry`\] \- the image repo URL to deploy from, if the build method is `registry`.
* `values` \[required\] \- the [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration) to use.

If the resource is an addon, the `config` block corresponds directly to the [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration).

#### Runtime Configuration[](#runtime-configuration "Direct link to heading")

The options for the runtime configuration (`config.values` for applications, `config` for addons) corresponds to the default Helm values for the application. If you have experience with Kubernetes/Helm, you can also view all possible configuration options in the `values.yaml` files of the respective applications: [web](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/web/values.yaml), [worker](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/worker/values.yaml), and [job](https://github.com/porter-dev/porter-charts/blob/master/applications/job/values.yaml). If you don't have this experience, please see the [examples](/preview-environments/examples) to view common configuration options.

#### Variable References[](#variable-references "Direct link to heading")

It is possible to reference output values from another resource to set configuration for the current resource. The syntax to reference dependent variables is as follows:

```
"{ .<resource_name>.<jsonpath> }"

```

The `<jsonpath>` section follows [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2) syntax. Most of the time, this will simply be a set of nested fields. For example, the `postgresql` addon outputs a fields `postgresqlPassword` and `postgresqlUsername`, so a resource named `postgres` can be referenced via:

```
POSTGRES_USERNAME: "{ .postgres.postgresqlUsername }"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "{ .postgres.postgresqlPassword }"

```
