title: "Getting Started on Porter with Go"
---

In this tutorial-style guide, we will be deploying a sample Go app to Porter.

##### Prerequisites

To proceed further with this guide, you will need access to a [Porter account](https://dashboard.getporter.dev/register). You also need to setup your Porter account with Github in order to deploy the app. You may follow the [Adding/Updating the Porter Github App](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github/adding-updating-gh-app#adding-the-porter-github-app) guide to do this.

## Set up[](#set-up "Direct link to heading")

Porter has a sample getting started Go app on Github at [porter-dev/go-getting-started](https://github.com/porter-dev/go-getting-started). If you look at the repository, you will find that it is a template repository which means that you can simply click on the **Use this template** button on the frontpage of the repository or navigate to [go-getting-started/generate](https://github.com/porter-dev/go-getting-started/generate) to generate a new repository based on this template.

## Deploy app to Porter[](#deploy-app-to-porter "Direct link to heading")

In the [Porter dashboard](https://dashboard.getporter.dev), go to the [Launch tab](https://dashboard.getporter.dev/launch).

![Launch Tab 1](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/e02adc93-4bda-4645-728a-aa6577ca2f00/large "Launch Tab - Choose a template")

Click on **Web Service > Launch Template** and choose the **Git Repository** deployment method.

![Launch Tab 2](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/821174d4-19ba-425e-11e2-7ad4f5241300/large "Launch Tab - Choose deployment method")

Choose the repository you generated in the **Set up** step. If you cannot find the repository from the search bar, make sure that you have given access to the Porter Github app. Refer to [Updating the Porter Github App](/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github/adding-updating-gh-app#updating-the-porter-github-app) to do this.

![Launch Tab 3](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/d8efe53e-e052-4aba-29ed-d647d7165200/large "Launch Tab - Choose git repository")

Click on the **main** branch, then click on **Continue**. You will be presented with a screen that looks like the following.

![Launch Tab 4](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/c4cb7748-3941-4c8e-cf28-56408a06c800/large "Launch Tab - Deployment information")

Click on **Continue > Deploy**. This will start deploying your app to Porter after which you will be redirected to the applications view. Here you will be able to see your newly created app.

![Applications View](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/e34830fe-c5a7-443d-0c98-06f75c6a2800/large "Applications Tab - Newly created app")

Click on the app in the applications view and you should be able to see the URL which will serve your newly created Go app.

![App URL](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/db3a5a69-cfa9-47d2-9448-1ba86a0e0c00/large "Newly created app")

Once the app is successfully deployed, navigate to the URL as above and you should see something like the following.

![Go App](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/9e3ca7f2-cf8d-4c49-17cd-43fddbf01400/large "Successfully deployed Go app")

**Congratulations!** You just deployed your first Go app on Porter!

## Next steps[](#next-steps "Direct link to heading")

Now that you have deployed your first app on Porter, feel free to make changes to the git repository that you created from [porter-dev/go-getting-started](https://github.com/porter-dev/go-getting-started) and push updates to your Porter app. You should also check out the documentation for some of the advanced topics.
