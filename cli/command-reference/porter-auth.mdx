`porter auth` contains commands for authenticating with a Porter instance.

### `porter auth login`[](#porter-auth-login "Direct link to heading")

Logs a user in to the Porter instance. This command will by default attempt to open your default browser to authenticate you. If this does not succeed, the command will output a URL to visit which will redirect you to the Porter instance.

If you would like to log in via a cookie-based mechanism by inputting an email/password, run:

```
porter auth login --manual

```

### `porter auth logout`[](#porter-auth-logout "Direct link to heading")

Logs a user out from a Porter instance.
