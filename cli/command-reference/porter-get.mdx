##### Prerequisites

* You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
* You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
* You're connected to the correct cluster by running [porter config set-cluster](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

  
`porter get` fetches basic information about a Porter application. It also supports outputting in the JSON and YAML formats.

#### Examples[](#examples "Direct link to heading")

To get information about a release named `sample-app`, you can run the following:

```
porter get sample-app

```

This command is namespace-scoped and uses the default namespace. To specify a different namespace, use the `--namespace` flag:

```
porter get sample-app --namespace custom-namespace

```

To output in a data interchange format such as JSON, use the `--output` flag:

```
porter get sample-app --output json

```

And similarly for YAML:

```
porter get sample-app --output yaml

```

### `porter get values`[](#porter-get-values "Direct link to heading")

This command can be used to fetch the Helm values of a release. For instance, to get the Helm values of a release named `sample-app`, you can run the following:

```
porter get values sample-app

```
