##### Prerequisites

* You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
* You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
* You're connected to the correct cluster by running [porter config set-cluster](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

  
`porter logs` logs the output from a given application. If an application has multiple instances, you will be prompted to select the instance. If you would like to tail logs from an application, run the command with the `--follow` flag:

```
porter logs [APP_NAME] --follow

```

To locate an application in a different namespace, run with the `--namespace` flag:

```
porter logs [APP_NAME] --namespace custom-ns

```
