To deploy a MongoDB instance on Porter, head to the **Community Add-ons** tab. You must specify username and password for the instance. You can optionally modify the size of the persistent volume attached to the database.

## Connecting to the Database[](#connecting-to-the-database "Direct link to heading")

MongoDB on Porter is by default only exposed to internal traffic - only applications and add-on's that are deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster can connect to the MongoDB instance. The DNS name for the instance can be found on the deployment view as shown below. Note that MongoDB listens on port 27017 by default.

![Mongo URI](https://imagedelivery.net/l4LYM_vOYKe7O1NCT_Nc_g/681b4436-0af2-41f5-e51f-1ec6027d1600/large "Screen Shot 2021-03-19 at 1.14.43 PM.png")

MongoDB provisioned through Porter has replica sets enabled by default. The connection URI for the MongoDB instance follows this format:

```
mongodb://root:${PASSWORD}@${REPLICASET_1}:27017,${REPLICASET_2}:27017/?authSource=admin&replicaSet=rs0

```

The `REPLICASET_1` and `REPLICASET_2` arguments are formed by the following:

```
REPLICASET_1=${pod_1}.${internal_uri}
REPLICASET_2=${pod_2}.${internal_uri}

```

So in this case, this would be:

```
REPLICASET_1=medicine-lucky-place-mongodb-0.medicine-lucky-place-mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local
REPLICASET_2=medicine-lucky-place-mongodb-1.medicine-lucky-place-mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local

```

And the full connection string would be:

```
mongodb://root:mongopassword@medicine-lucky-place-mongodb-0.medicine-lucky-place-mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local:27017,medicine-lucky-place-mongodb-1.medicine-lucky-place-mongodb.default.svc.cluster.local:27017/?authSource=admin&replicaSet=rs0

```

## Deletion[](#deletion "Direct link to heading")

To delete this add-on, navigate to the **Settings** tab of the deployment. Note that deleting from the Porter dashboard will not delete the persistent volumes that have been attached to your MongoDB instance. To delete these dangling volumes, see the next section.

## Persistent Volumes[](#persistent-volumes "Direct link to heading")

### AWS[](#aws "Direct link to heading")

By default, Porter creates [EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes.html) of type **gp2** (general purpose SSD) volumes that are attached to the database. To view the volumes attached to your cluster, navigate to **EC2 > Volumes** tab in your AWS console.

##### Warning

The unnamed 100GB volumes are attached to your EKS cluster itself. Make sure to not delete them - this will make your cluster not functional.

Click on the volume and navigate to the **Tags** tab to see which deployment the volume belongs to. You can modify, delete, and make a snapshot of this volume from the AWS console.
